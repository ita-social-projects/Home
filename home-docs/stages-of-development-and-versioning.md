# Stages of the development and versioning process

This document provides practical guidelines for developers who write or contribute 
to a Home application. It describes the steps in developing a project using
the Git Flow method from creation of your working branch to release.

### Git Flow
___
This Git Flow schema is derived from Vincent Driessen’s « [A Successful Git Branching Model](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) »:

</p>

 - **master branch** contains all the stable, released code. You should never work
directly on master and never push to it from a local version.


 - **dev branch** is inherited from the latest master. Developers have to create a 
separate branch for each task, inherited from the dev branch.


 - **release branch** or ReleaseCandidate (RC) branch is a temporary branch. Support 
for preparing a new product release. Allows you to fix small bugs and prepare different 
metadata for the release.


 - **feature branch** is created for each new function it is necessary to assign
its own branch. The development of new features starts from the "**dev**" branch. 
When the function is completed, the corresponding branch is merged with the "**dev**"
branch.


 - **hotfix branch** this is a branch for patches. It should contain only immediate
fixes for released versions that cannot wait for the next scheduled product release. 
When the fix is ready, it is merged back into the "**dev**" and "**master**" branches.


On the Home project at this stage of development there are no **master** and **release** branches yet.

### Branching
___

 1. Go to the dev branch:
    > git checkout dev
 2. Update the dev branch to the latest version:
    > git pull
 3. Make a new branch off of dev:
    > git checkout -b your-feature

A branch name must start with a tag `feature/`, `release/`, `hotfix/` and then the
word `Issue#123` with number of your task Branch names should be lower-case and 
use hyphens to separate words. Use descriptive branch names.

Example:

```
Good:
    feature/Issue#123-Create-some-new-feature
    hotfix/Issue#123-Fix-problem-with-something
    release/Issue#123-Release-new-features
    
Bad:
    feature/Issue#123
    feature/Issue#123-Feature
    Issue#123-Create-some-new-feature
    Feature/issue#123-Create-Some-New-Feature
    feature/Issue#123_Create_some_new_feature
    hotfix/Issue#123-Fix-problem-with-something-(problem-with-method)
```

### Make changes
___

 4. Making changes (writing code) in your branch.


 5. Make sure you have the project built:
    > mvn clean install
 6. Make sure all tests are successful (write your own tests if necessary).
 You can learn how to run tests [here](https://github.com/ita-social-projects/Home/blob/dev/home-docs/home-api-tests.md).

### Commit and push
___

 7. Make a commit of your changes:
    >git add -p\
     git commit -m "commit message"

A commit should contain one conceptual change to your code. A commit should 
contain one self-contained, reversible, readable change to your code. Start name of
commit with `Issue#123` and **short** information about your changes.

Example:

```
Good:
    Issue#123 Changed UserService and added new tests
    Issue#123 Fixed bug with adding new user
    
Bad:
    Commit 1
    Issue#123
    Issue#123 New method
    Issue#123 Super long message ...
```

 8. Push your commit:
    > git push

### Pull Requests
___

 9. Open pull request in GitHub and editing the description according to the 
template.


 10. The CI (`Review_workflow.yml`) tests will automatically run.


 11. Code review. <ins>**Other devs should review code and leave notes**</ins>. Other devs 
should give the code the thumbs up (at least two other devs).

### Merging
___

 12. After your code is reviewed by two or more developers, you will be confident
in the code you have written, and everything will be tested. You can start the 
deployment process in your pull request.


 13. The CI tests will automatically run and after that, the CD 
(`Build_and_deploy_workflow.yml`) tests will begin too.


 14. After successfully passing the tests, new packages with updated modules will
be deployed in GitHub Packages, updated images in DockerHub and deployed on Heroku 
with the current version of build (more about the version below).


 15. Check the functionality of the project on Heroku and any changes that have
been made to the main branch to make sure the task is complete. After that,
you can put the job in "closed".
 
### Versioning approach
___

Semantic versioning: **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-BUILDNUMBER** (Home project version - 0.0.1):

 - **MAJOR** version when you make incompatible API changes,
 - **MINOR** version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
 - **PATCH** version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.


After a successful building and merging the working branch with the main branch, 
the relevant version of the build [packages](https://github.com/orgs/ita-social-projects/packages?repo_name=Home)
will be generated:

 - dev ⟶ 0.0.1-10-dev 
 - release ⟶ 0.0.1-10-rc
 - hotfix ⟶ 0.0.1-10_hotfix-branchName
 - other ⟶ 0.0.1-10_tagName-branchName


And will generate images (application, migration) on Home project [DockerHab](https://hub.docker.com/u/homeacademy)
with short name of commit:

 - dev ⟶ 0.0.1-10-dev-qwe123
 - release ⟶ 0.0.1-10-rc-qwe123


On **Heroku**, you can check the current build version and date of build by going to
